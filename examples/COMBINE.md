# COMBINE standards in modelspec

To illustrate the utility of modelspec, and to create a uniform, compatible set of APIs across a diverse range of model specification formats, we are investigating the [COMBINE set of standards in computational biology](https://co.mbine.org/standards/), and attempting to express these formats in modelspec.

## NeuroML

A preliminary version of an API for [NeuroML2](https://docs.neuroml.org/Userdocs/NeuroMLv2.html) can be found [here](NeuroML).

## SBML

work towards an API for [SBML](https://www.sbml.org/) can be found [here](SBML).

## CellML
